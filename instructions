**Explanation of Packages:**

* `opencv-python`: Essential for all image processing, manipulation, and drawing functionalities (e.g., reading/writing images, applying filters, drawing shapes).
* `Pillow`: Used for handling image formats and converting images for display within the Tkinter GUI.
* `numpy`: Fundamental for numerical operations, particularly for image data which is often represented as NumPy arrays by OpenCV.
